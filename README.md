# Data-Science
Python practicals that cover the core areas of Data Science (eg. models for regression and classification) from several perspectives: conceptual formulation and properties, solution algorithms and their implementation, data visualization for exploratory data analysis and the effective presentation of modelling outputs.

- `Practical 1`: Linear Regression (Scikit-Learn) *Defining a model, fitting a model, least squares regression, linear regression, gradient descent, scikit-learn*
- `Practical 2`: Classification I (Scikit-Learn) *Classification, logistic regression, perceptron, multi-class classification, classification performance measures*
- `Practical 3`: Cassification II (Scikit-Learn) *An overview of other classification techniques (e.g., decision trees, SVMs) and more advanced techniques including ensemble-based models (boosting, bagging, exemplified with AdaBoost and Random Forests)* 
- `Practical 4`: Deep Learning I (TensorFlow) *Neural networks, applications in the world, optimization, stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation, learning rates. Introduction to TensorFlow, minimal TensorFlow example, symbolic graphs, training a network, practical tips for deep learning*
- `Practical 5`: Deep Learning II (TensorFlow) *Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTMs, autoencoders, regularization*
- `Practical 6`: Visualization *Scales and coordinates, depicting comparisons. Common plotting patterns, including dimension reduction*
